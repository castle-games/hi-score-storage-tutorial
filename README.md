# High Score Storage Tutorial

This repo includes a minimal example of a Castle game that saves and loads the player's high score using Castle's [Storage API](https://castle.games/documentation/storage-api-reference).

See the [Castle Blog](https://medium.com/castle-archives) for a tutorial that accompanies this repo.
